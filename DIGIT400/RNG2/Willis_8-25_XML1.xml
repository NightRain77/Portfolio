    <header>An exploration of how and why places become invested with SACREDNESS and how the SACRED
        is embodied or made manifest through ART and ARCHITECTURE</header>
    <title>ISLE SHRINE, <location type="country">JAPAN</location></title>
    <p n="1">Trees and stones have long been objects of deep devotion in <location type="country"
            >Japan</location>. Originally there were no shrine buildings; instead a tree, forest, or
        a large boulder or a mountain, festooned with ropes, would be the focus of worship.</p>
    <p n="2">In <location type="country">Japan</location> the mysterious forces of nature, called ke, were
        believed to permeate palpable matter and formless space <paren>(collectively called mono in
                <language>Japanese</language>)</paren> to create mononoke. Mononoke was seen to
        coalesce in trees and stones. Certain trees, especially the
            <plantSpecies>cryptomeria</plantSpecies> and the <plantSpecies>evergreen
            sakaki</plantSpecies>, were considered sacred for this reason. When one of these trees
        was felled and the wood used in the construction of a shrine, this sacred quality was
        believed to follow it into the building. The sacred tree itself was literally and
        symbolically present in the form of a pillar or post around which the shrine was
        constructed.</p>
    <p n="3">The great <religion>Shinto</religion> shrine at <location type="city">Ise</location> is built
        amid a dense forest of giant <plantSpecies>cryptomeria</plantSpecies> trees next to the
            <landmark type="river">Isuzu River </landmark>at the foot of <landmark type="mountain"
            >Mount Kamiji</landmark> and <landmark type="mountain">Mount Shimaji</landmark> in the
            <location type="prefecture">Mie Prefecture</location>
        <link>[see Mie Prefecture]</link> in southern <location type="island">Honshu</location>,
            <location type="country">Japan</location>. Crossing the Uji Bridge and passing through
        the large torii gate marking the entrance to the shrine, a long path leads to
            <shrineName>Ise Jingu</shrineName>
        <paren>(<shrineName>Ise Grand Shrine</shrineName>)</paren>.</p>
    <p n="4">The shrine consists of two groups of buildings: the <shrineName>Imperial Shrine</shrineName>
        <paren>(Kotai Jingu)</paren>, also known as the Naiku <paren>(inner shrine)</paren>, and the
            <shrineName>Toyouke Shrine</shrineName>
        <paren>(Toyouke Daijingu )</paren> which constitutes the Geku or outer shrine. The Naiku is
        dedicated to the <diety>Sun Goddess Amaterasu Omikami</diety>
        <paren>(Heaven-Illuminating Great Deity)</paren>, and the Geku to the <diety>Goddess of
            Cereals Toyouke Omikami</diety>
        <paren>(Abundant Food Great Deity)</paren>. Each shrine is composed of a number of
        buildings, including ancillary shrines, workshops, storehouses, etc. Each shrine has an
        inner precinct with a main sanctuary and two attendant shrines, as well as treasuries,
        fences, and gates.</p>
    <p n="5">Both shrines are constructed of wood, and every twenty years both are totally rebuilt on an
        adjoining site. The empty site of the previous shrine <paren>(called the kodenchi)</paren>
        is strewn with large white pebbles. The only building on the empty site, which retains its
        sacredness for the intervening twenty years, is a small wooden shed or hut
            <paren>(oi-ya)</paren> inside of which is a post about seven feet high known as
        shin-no-mihashira <paren>(literally the august column of the heart, or more freely
            translated as sacred central post)</paren>. The new shrine will be erected over and
        around this post which are the holiest and most mysterious objects in the <shrineName>Ise
            Shrine</shrineName>. They remain hidden at all times.</p>

    <p n="6"><person type="author">Kenzo Tange</person> and <person type="author">Noboru Kawazoe</person>
        <paren>(p. 167, see Bibliography below)</paren> suggest that: <quote>the erection of a
            single post in the center of a sacred area strewn with stones represents the form taken
            by <ethnicity>Japanese</ethnicity> places of worship in very ancient times; the
            shin-no-mihashira would thus be the survival of a symbolism from a very pimitive
            symbolism to the present day.</quote> The present buildings reproduce the temple first
        ceremoniously rebuilt in 692 CE by <person type="leader">Empress Jito.</person> The first
        temple had been built by her husband <person type="leader">Emperor Temmu</person>
        <paren>(678-686)</paren>, the first Mikado to rule over a united <location type="country"
            >Japan</location>.</p>
    <p n="7"><person type="leader">Emperor Temmu</person> had established <location type="city"
            >Ise</location> as the principal cult shrine of Imperial <location type="country"
            >Japan</location>, but the site itself, and the <plantSpecies>cryptomeria</plantSpecies>
        trees that grew on it, were already sacred before then. The
            <plantSpecies>cryptomeria</plantSpecies> is a tree associated with
            <religion>Shinto</religion> shrines. The principal sacred plant of
            <religion>Shinto</religion>, however, is the <plantSpecies>sakaki</plantSpecies>
        <paren>(a shrub related to the tea bush)</paren>. The shin-no-mihashira is taken to
        represent a branch of the <plantSpecies>sakaki</plantSpecies> stuck upright in the ground.</p>
    <p n="8">The chambers of the shrines are raised on timber piles which themselves are analogous to the
        central sacred post. The roof is not supported by the walls <paren>(although the rafters do
            rest on purlins)</paren>, but the ridge beam is carried instead by two large columns at
        either end which embedded directly into the ground without any foundation.</p>
    <p n="9">Besides trees, at the <shrineName><location type="city">Ise</location> Shrine</shrineName>
        are many subsidiary shrines of rocks from the sea which are regarded as the abodes
            <paren>(iwakura or rock abodes)</paren> of deities.</p>
