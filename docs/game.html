        <h3>Sand: A Superfluous Game</h3>
        <img src="images/Sand.gif" height="400" width="600"/>
        <p>Sand is an indie game that is currently in its Alpha testing stages. The game was created by Voided Pixels Studio, and it can be downloaded on itch.io. The game is downloadable only for Windows at this time.</p>
        <p>I chose to play and review this game because it looked simple, cute, and fun! To be completely honest the short gameplay video they have on their itch.io page that shows the player riding a llama is what really sold it for me. I love animals, even pixelated ones! Now, as a disclaimer, this is not a full review, as I was unable to play through the whole game within the time period of this project. It is a fun game to play though, so I plan to finish it at some point!</p>
        <h3>Starting Out</h3>
        <img src="images/Sand_mainscreen.PNG"height="300" width="500"/><img src="images/Sand1_EarlyGame.PNG"height="300" width="500"/>
        <p>The photo on the left is the main menu of the game. Under "Options" the only settings are to reset the quests, reset the map, or reset the entire game. Under "Prefab Designer" it takes you into a different version of the game which may be for the creators to test things in (I'm not completely sure). So other than the reset options and the volume sliders on the bottom, there are no settings for this game. The picture on the right is of the starter house, I took this right after completing the first quest. In the picture you can see the player (the white haired character) and the dog companion you get. Using the little doghouse on the side, you are able to cycle through two options for the apperance of your dog, and you can give it a custom name. I named mine Sandy because the game is set in a desert (creative, I know). There is not much of a tutorial, the litle bit you get is from talking to the main quest giver, and NPC robot/alien named E.D.I.E. It isn't too hard to figure out how to do things without a thorough tutorial, and I liked how the creator tried to put most of the tutorial into the quests.</p>
