        <h3>Sand: A Superfluous Game</h3>
        <p>Sand is an indie game that is currently in its Alpha testing stages. The game was created by Voided Pixels Studio, and it can be downloaded on itch.io. The game is downloadable only for Windows at this time.</p>
        <p>I chose to play and review this game because it looked simple, cute, and fun! To be completely honest the short gameplay video they have on their itch.io page that shows the player riding a llama is what really sold it for me. I love animals, even pixelated ones!</p>
