        <h3>DIGIT 210: Large Scale Text Analysis and DIGIT 400: DIGIT Project Design</h4>
        <p>I took DIGIT 210 in Spring 2021 as a Sophomore. This class started off with a lot of review from DIGIT 110, and then got into some new topics later on. Such as, Xquery, SVG, Cytoscape, and a little bit of Python. Our main project for the class was a group project where we formed teams to analyze a collection of documents of our choosing and later on present our findings using a project site that we created together. My project group chose to focus on songs from Disney's Aladdin franchise, and our findings were pretty interesting. </p>
        <br>
        <p>We worked on most of the project together, and as we had previously worked on a similar project together, Jackie Chan and I took the lead and tried to help and teach our other group member as the semester progressed. This project involved a little bit of everything we covered in class as well as some topics from DIGIT 110.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I took DIGIT 400 in Fall 2021 as a Junior. This class went deeper into coding and taught me new topics (one of those being JavaScript). As our project for this class, Jackie Chan and I decided to add onto our Disney Songs project from the previous semeseter. We started with redesigning the website, then added new songs into the collection (from the Beauty and the Beast franchise). Then as we reviewed and learned new subjects in class, we built on to what we already had done and made our project a lot better. </p>
