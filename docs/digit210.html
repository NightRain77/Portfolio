        <h3>DIGIT 210: Large Scale Text Analysis</h4>
        <p>I took DIGIT 210 in Spring 2021 as a Sophomore. This class started off with a lot of review from DIGIT 110, and then got into some new topics later on. Such as, Xquery, SVG, Cytoscape, and a little bit of Python. Our main project for the class was a group project where we formed teams to analyze a collection of documents of our choosing and later on present our findings using a project site that we created together. My project group chose to focus on songs from Disney's Aladdin franchise, and our findings were pretty interesting. </p>
        <br>
        <p>We worked on most of the project together, and as we had previously worked on a similar project together, Jackie Chan and I took the lead and tried to help and teach our other group member as the semester progressed. This project involved a little bit of everything we covered in class as well as some topics from DIGIT 110.</p>
