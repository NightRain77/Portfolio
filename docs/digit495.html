        <h3>DIGIT 495: Internship</h4>
        <p>I took DIGIT 495 in Summer 2021. I interned in the IT department at Erie Insurance as an IT Analyst. Here I have posted weekly notes I took throughout the course of the internship about my experiences and what I learned. Also as a requirement for this course I had to ask my manager at Erie Insurance to fill out two evaluations for me, one at midterms and the other at finals.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Week 1</h4>
        <p>This was my first week as an intern at Erie Insurance, so a lot of my time was spent on setup and some training. Monday was a little bumpy, a lot of the interns including myself had some tech issues that we had to get sorted out. Eventually, we did get it. I and the two others in my group who started with me were all online by Wednesday morning. The rest of my week was meetings with my mentor to introduce me to some of the programs used at Erie. On Thursday we started going over the processes for the work I will be doing with her during the summer. She said that we will be working parallel so that I can learn easier and not just be thrown into something completely new. She has been very helpful and patient so far, and I think working with her will be a good experience.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Week 2</h4>
        <p>This week was pretty similar to the last, another wave of interns started on Monday so it was still a lot of orientation. My mentor met with me almost every day and continued to explain the processes of what we will be working on, and even assigned two reports for me to do on Service Now. I had a bit of trouble at first, I looked for things in the wrong places. But she was willing to call and help me sort everything out so I feel like I have a better understanding of how the site operates and how to create reports. Then on Friday, I met with our team's manager to get to know each other a bit and to discuss Erie and future plans. It was a really nice conversation and it is amazing to know how dedicated Erie employees are to making their interns feel welcome and supported. He even offered to set up a meeting with me with some of the employees who work on more digital media related projects because I am a DIGIT major and he wants to give me every opportunity to grow that he can. I'm really impressed with the community and the environment at Erie, their standards are clearly carrying over even while working remotely. I'm glad to be a part of this team.Â </p>

        <h4>Week 3</h4>
        <p>This week I got into working on more assignments. I helped update descriptions and toward the end of the week, I was tasked with creating releases for July-December. I think I figured it out pretty quickly. Also, I am starting to get a better understanding of how to operate in ServiceNow with the help of my mentor. Another thing I did this week was attended more intern events. The first was an intern kickoff where all of the interns introduced themselves and got to meet some employees who work with organizing the intern events. The second was a career development session. I believe they said there will be several more of these throughout the internship. In that meeting, they taught us how to build ourselves up professionally and utilize social media to do so. It was interesting to listen to and I am curious to see what they will talk about in the next one.</p>
