        <h3>DIGIT 495: Internship</h4>
        <p>I took DIGIT 495 in Summer 2021. I interned in the IT department at Erie Insurance as an IT Analyst. Here I have posted weekly notes I took throughout the course of the internship about my experiences and what I learned. Also as a requirement for this course I had to ask my manager at Erie Insurance to fill out two evaluations for me, one at midterms and the other at finals.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Week 1</h4>
        <p>This was my first week as an intern at Erie Insurance, so a lot of my time was spent on setup and some training. Monday was a little bumpy, a lot of the interns including myself had some tech issues that we had to get sorted out. Eventually, we did get it. I and the two others in my group who started with me were all online by Wednesday morning. The rest of my week was meetings with my mentor to introduce me to some of the programs used at Erie. On Thursday we started going over the processes for the work I will be doing with her during the summer. She said that we will be working parallel so that I can learn easier and not just be thrown into something completely new. She has been very helpful and patient so far, and I think working with her will be a good experience.</p>
