        <h3>DIGIT 495: Internship</h4>
        <p>I took DIGIT 495 in Summer 2021. I interned in the IT department at Erie Insurance as an IT Analyst. Here I have posted weekly notes I took throughout the course of the internship about my experiences and what I learned. Also as a requirement for this course I had to ask my manager at Erie Insurance to fill out two evaluations for me, one at midterms and the other at finals.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Week 1</h4>
        <p>This was my first week as an intern at Erie Insurance, so a lot of my time was spent on setup and some training. Monday was a little bumpy, a lot of the interns including myself had some tech issues that we had to get sorted out. Eventually, we did get it. I and the two others in my group who started with me were all online by Wednesday morning. The rest of my week was meetings with my mentor to introduce me to some of the programs used at Erie. On Thursday we started going over the processes for the work I will be doing with her during the summer. She said that we will be working parallel so that I can learn easier and not just be thrown into something completely new. She has been very helpful and patient so far, and I think working with her will be a good experience.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Week 2</h4>
        <p>This week was pretty similar to the last, another wave of interns started on Monday so it was still a lot of orientation. My mentor met with me almost every day and continued to explain the processes of what we will be working on, and even assigned two reports for me to do on Service Now. I had a bit of trouble at first, I looked for things in the wrong places. But she was willing to call and help me sort everything out so I feel like I have a better understanding of how the site operates and how to create reports. Then on Friday, I met with our team's manager to get to know each other a bit and to discuss Erie and future plans. It was a really nice conversation and it is amazing to know how dedicated Erie employees are to making their interns feel welcome and supported. He even offered to set up a meeting with me with some of the employees who work on more digital media related projects because I am a DIGIT major and he wants to give me every opportunity to grow that he can. I'm really impressed with the community and the environment at Erie, their standards are clearly carrying over even while working remotely. I'm glad to be a part of this team. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Week 3</h4>
        <p>This week I got into working on more assignments. I helped update descriptions and toward the end of the week, I was tasked with creating releases for July-December. I think I figured it out pretty quickly. Also, I am starting to get a better understanding of how to operate in ServiceNow with the help of my mentor. Another thing I did this week was attended more intern events. The first was an intern kickoff where all of the interns introduced themselves and got to meet some employees who work with organizing the intern events. The second was a career development session. I believe they said there will be several more of these throughout the internship. In that meeting, they taught us how to build ourselves up professionally and utilize social media to do so. It was interesting to listen to and I am curious to see what they will talk about in the next one.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Week 4</h4>
        <p>This week I was introduced to SharePoint and was asked by my mentor to use HTML to help them design a webpage for IT Services. I haven't yet been able to get the exact look she requested, but I was able to get links to the other pages to work. I also participated in more intern networking events, one of which talked about Erie's affiliation with different charities and nonprofits.  We were encouraged to start looking into them and consider volunteering or supporting them in any way we can. Then, my core team talked to us about the intern summer projects that we will have to present at the end of the summer. My mentor hasn't yet talked to me about what mine will be, but I'm hoping she will have more information for me next week.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Week 5</h4>
        <p>This week my mentor told me what my official project for the summer will be - I'll be working on Continuous Release Expansion. She is also having me work on the team's SharePoint page as a side project. It's taking me a little while to get used to writing code in SharePoint, but hopefully, I'll be able to figure some things out soon. This week I also worked on editing educational PowerPoints used to inform employees of the different release processes. I updated information so that it remained relevant and I did a little bit of moving around to make the slides more visually appealing. Friday afternoon I met with a member of the Talent Acquisition team for a get to know each other meeting. I think it really speaks to how much Erie values every employee no matter how new, young, or inexperienced that fellow employees set up meetings just to learn about you.</p>
