       <h4>What are the most significant challenges for a new learner?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>GitHub Pages</li>
            <li>WordPress</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>What advantages do you associate with one method over the other and what challenges are there for modifying the layout and organization of each site?</h4>
                <ul>
            <li>With GitHub Pages I personally feel like you have more control over what your website looks like. I don't know exactly how much WordPress has to offer in terms of styling, but I used a pre-existing format for my website on the page and because I struggled with learning how to use the site I didn't look into any extra styling options. With GitHub Pages you make your website using html and css, this allows you to have complete control over what it looks like, and if you need to find out how to do something the internet contains a ton of tutorials for different css styling options.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I never really understood WordPress that well, so I didn't look into any extra styling/customization. But I suppose if you are trying to build a site in a rush and you already know WordPress decently, the pre-existing layouts would work well for you. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What skills are necessary to learn and develop these sites in either format?</h4>
                <ul>
            <li>GitHub Pages</li>
            <li>WordPress</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What skills do you think you want to learn to improve on this website?</h4>
                <ul>
            <li>Honestly I think the main thing with GitHub Pages I want to improve on is css styling. Because a lot of projects are on deadlines and I am often busy with other classes, work, and club activities, I don't get a lot of time to really dive deep and see what all there is to offer. Sometime when I have more free time and don't have to complete it for an assignment, I'd like to sit down and learn some more css.</li>
            <li>I need to improve on a lot on WordPress. I barely brushed the surface of what there is to offer on the site and it would be nice to learn more about the options so that I can use it as an option if I ever need to create a website in the future.</li>
        </ul>
