        <h3>GitHub Pages vs. WordPress</h3>
       <h4>What are the most significant challenges for a new learner?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I think when I first started learning how to use GitHub Pages I was really confused about how to use GitBash to upload/update my files. The commands for it are very specific and if you don't make sure you are doing things in the right order then you can mess things up. Also, understanding all of the different tags for HTML and CSS took a while for me to get used to. </li>
            <li>WordPress isn't my favorite thing to work with, things are set up kind of weird and it took a while for me to find the things I was looking for. There are a ton of options I still don't even know about and I'm sure there are probably some mistakes among what I did figure out. </li>
        </ul>
    <h4>What advantages do you associate with one method over the other and what challenges are there for modifying the layout and organization of each site?</h4>
                <ul>
            <li>With GitHub Pages I feel like you have more control over what your website looks like. I don't know exactly how much WordPress has to offer in terms of styling, but I used a pre-existing format for my website on the page, and because I struggled with learning how to use the site I didn't look into any extra styling options. With GitHub Pages you make your website using HTML and CSS, this allows you to have complete control over what it looks like, and if you need to find out how to do something the internet contains a ton of tutorials for different CSS styling options.</li>
            <li>As I said, I never really understood WordPress that well, so I didn't look into any extra styling/customization. But I suppose if you are trying to build a site in a rush and you already know WordPress decently, the pre-existing layouts would work well for you. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What skills are necessary to learn and develop these sites in either format?</h4>
                <ul>
            <li>For GitHub Pages you need to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. For both of these though, there are a lot of resources available online to help you learn them quickly, and they are always available for reference. You also need to have an understanding of the GitHub Pages site and how to use GitBash to upload/update your work.</li>
            <li>For WordPress it seems like you just need to have patience and the willpower to go through and look at everything and teach yourself. It's not as widely used as HTML is, so you're less likely to find helpful resources about it. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What skills do you think you want to learn to improve on this website?</h4>
                <ul>
            <li>Honestly I think the main thing with GitHub Pages I want to improve on is CSS styling. Because a lot of projects are on deadlines and I am often busy with other classes, work, and club activities, I don't get a lot of time to dive deep and see what all there is to offer. When I have more free time and don't have to complete it for an assignment, I'd like to sit down and learn some more CSS.</li>
            <li>I need to improve a lot on WordPress. I barely brushed the surface of what there is to offer on the site and it would be nice to learn more about the options so that I can consider using WordPress if I ever need to create a website in the future.</li>
        </ul>
