        <p>A little more about me...</p>
        <p>On campus I am an honors student and a member of the Theta Phi Aplha sorority. Through these groups I am involved in quite a few service projects. Outside of school I am currently a substitute teacher at the Early Connections daycare center in Union City. I work as often as possible between my classes, and I work with both the toddler and pre-school classrooms. I am also involved in a lot of volunteering and service projects outside of my organizations.</p>
