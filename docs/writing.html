    <h3>Letter to Love</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
    <th><p>My Dear Love,</p> 
	<p>Oh, there are so many things I wish to say to you, feelings I wish to express for which there are no words. Your existence is a blessing I feel nobody on this earth deserves. You make me feel whole, you entered my life and you changed me forever. My view of the world, the people and things surrounding me, everything is different now that I have Love. 
	But with every relationship there are hardships. We’ve entered into a dangerous territory, allowing Jealousy, Fear, and Loneliness to interrupt the beautiful understanding we have. You are so complex, so confusing, so irrational – and yet, you are everything to me. What am I without Love?</p> 
	<p>The answer is simple. I am nothing. I have danced with Depression and allowed Doubt to infiltrate my life before. Loneliness almost killed me, but Love, you brought me back. You took one look at me and decided I was Worth It. You pulled me away from Depression’s grasp and into your own warm arms. You made me feel safe and wanted. You still do. 
	Despite this, Fear still catches hold of me from time to time. He whispers in my ear things that I all too easily believe. Nothing in life is certain. One day I could wake up and you could be gone. I’d be left alone, defenseless against what you helped me escape. I want you to be a certainty. Though you sometimes bring Pain, I want you with me always.</p> 
	<p>My Dear Love,</p>
	<p>Please</p>
	<p>Stay.</p>

                <p>She desperately tried to hide </p>
                <p>Behind a thin veil of her hair </p>
                <p>But she knew they were still watching.</p> 
                <p>Predator and prey.</p> 
                <p>They wouldn’t look away</p> 
                <p>From their newest victim.</p>
<br/>
                <p>With every word she uttered</p>
                <p>Their muffled laughter got louder.</p>
                <p>Her allies couldn’t save her</p> 
                <p>From the torture she knew</p> 
                <p>She would now have to endure.</p> 
<br/>
                <p>The beasts’ cruelty would follow her</p> 
                <p>Making her existence miserable,</p> 
                <p>Until they found a new victim</p>
                <p>To punish with their endless taunts.</p>
<br/>
                <p>In this jungle</p>
                <p>It is kill </p>
                <p>Or be killed</p>
                <p>Only the strong survive.</p>

            <p>Joy is meant to be a treat</p>
            <p>One emotion among many</p>
            <p>But some think happiness</p> 
            <p>Is meant to be universal</p>
            <p>Agree and you are normal</p>
            <p>Disagree and you are not</p>
            <p>Most do not understand</p>   
            <p>What it is to be unhappy</p>
            <p>Because happiness</p>
            <p>Is a beautiful lie</p>
            <p>And sadness</p> 
            <p>Is an ugly truth</p>

                <p>some puzzles may never get finished</p>
                <p>so take time to piece yours together</p>
                <p>and enjoy the time you have</p>
                <p>because some can’t experience</p>
