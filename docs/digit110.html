        <p>I took DIGIT 110 in Fall 2020, in the class we learned many things including xml, regex, relaxNG, html, css, and more. Our main project for the class was a group project where we formed teams to markup a document and make a digital version of it basically. My project group marked up a collections of poems written by Langston Hughes titled "Montage of a Dream Deferred." </p>
        <br>
        <p>We worked on most of the project together, but the main parts I contributed to were the original xml markup and schema creation, some css work, and the co-creation of the "About the Project" page for our website.</p>
        <br>
